This Power BI project provides a comprehensive view of garment manufacturing performance, focusing on production efficiency, module utilization and style-wise output tracking. The dashboard integrates multiple data sources to visualize real-time production metrics, enabling better planning and operational decisions.

* Key Features:

Overall Production Summary:
Displays total pieces produced, active modules, and planned styles to give a high-level view of manufacturing progress.

Style-wise Analysis:
Pie and bar charts show distribution of total production across product types (e.g., T-shirts, sports wear, long sleeves), helping identify high-performing and underperforming styles.

Module Utilization Insights:
Visualizes production volume by each sewing module, highlighting productivity and efficiency variations.

Daily Plan vs. Actual Monitoring:
Tracks daily production demand, cell capacity, and team member requirements, supporting data-driven workforce planning.

Time-based Trend Visualization:
Week-over-week view of production activity for continuous improvement and forecasting.

* Tools & Technologies:

Power BI (for visualization and dashboard design)

Excel / SQL (for data extraction and transformation)

DAX (for calculated measures and KPIs)

* Impact:

Improved visibility into production performance

Enhanced planning accuracy and resource allocation

Data-backed decision-making for manufacturing operations
